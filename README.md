# Tag Me Business Socials Link app

This was meant to be a clone of the Dot business card but as a FOSS solution.
But I ran into an issue trying to implement the NFC functionality. Turns out one of the coolest features in modern tech is still locked behind a superficial wall and we can't have nice things. NFC functionality only works with Android via tags and not directly with phone to phone anymore.

So the end result is just a way to store socialis as a list of cards, and clicking on th cards opens a QR code that can be scanned. The usecase is that everyone has a phone with a camera that supports QR codes so this makes it easier still and less record keeping.

## Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
